# A New Age of Disinformation

Economic inequality is not only a structural condition—it is a narrative battleground. Scholarship shows that rising inequality erodes political trust and depresses engagement. **What’s less understood is *how* that erosion travels through stories, symbols, and identities.** <!--more-->

My research examines how inequality creates conditions for **narrative hijacking**: the reframing of economic grievances into identity-based conflicts that redirect attention away from inequality itself.

Building on comparative political economy and political psychology, I focus on two mechanisms:

1. **Rational withdrawal.** As costs of participation rise and returns feel uncertain, disengaged citizens strategically step back from mainstream politics. This withdrawal opens space for **political entrepreneurs** to mobilize discontent with divisive cues that convert material frustration into cultural threat.

2. **Informal (para-economic) tipping points.** When informal or illicit economic activity crosses critical thresholds, institutional trust collapses. Elites lose narrative control, creating openings for alternative actors to script new stories of blame and belonging.

**Contribution.** The project links disinformation, political trust, narrative memory, and communication into a single framework. By showing how socio-technical imaginaries can be activated for polarization, it advances theory, offers tools for narrative analysis, and provides insights for democratic resilience in Europe.

**What’s next.** The series maps how core mechanisms of social cohesion are corrupted by disinformation—and how that process erodes trust in both institutions and the very idea of democracy. I’ll pair theoretical analysis with practical tooling for narrative tracing and measurement.
