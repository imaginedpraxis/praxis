# A New Age of Disinformation 

Economic inequality is not only a structural condition but also a narrative battleground. While scholarship has shown that rising inequality erodes political trust and depresses engagement, the narrative pathways through which this erosion unfolds remain underexplored. 

My research investigates how inequality creates conditions for narrative hijacking: the reframing of economic grievances into identity-based conflicts that redirect attention away from inequality itself.

Building on comparative political economy and political psychology, I focus on two mechanisms. First, the **“rational withdrawal”** of disengaged citizens from mainstream politics creates space for **political entrepreneurs** to mobilize discontent through divisive cues. Second, in contexts where para-economic activity exceeds critical thresholds, institutional trust collapses and elites lose narrative control, leaving space for alternative actors to script new stories of blame and belonging.

The project contributes a novel framework that links inequality, political trust, and narrative memory. By showing how trauma-linked imaginaries can be mobilized for polarisation, it aims to advance theory, deliver methodological tools for narrative analysis, and provide insights relevant to democratic resilience in Europe.
