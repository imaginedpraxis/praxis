# Part II — Frameworks for Tracing Sociotechnical Imaginaries

In the previous posts I outlined imaginaries as **systems**—interlocking, normative frameworks sustained by identity and narrative. I had initially planned to focus here on *adversarial imaginaries* in relation to democracy and identity corruption under disinformation. **I’m changing course.** <!--more-->

To build toward a more systemic analysis of sociotechnical systems—and the risks posed by contemporary disinformation—this part centers on the **frameworks and theoritical tools** best suited to trace, map, and understand such systems.

## Mapping imaginaries through disciplinary frameworks

Substantial work has sought to trace sociotechnical systems and embed them within broader accounts of **macro-level evolution**. The field of **journalism** is especially fruitful: its *performative* dimension means imaginaries are publicly enacted and documented.

The digital transformation of journalism has unfolded as a sequence of **promises, anxieties, and reinventions**. From the optimism of early online news to the platformization of the 2010s and today’s fascination with AI, each phase articulated a distinct technological future for journalism.

An intrestring project would be to further investigate the **turning points in journalism’s sociotechnical imaginaries** and more specificaly how particular narratives, terms, metaphors, and emotional framings took hold, and how these shifts enabled collective identity formation. It is my hypothesis that one could by combining computational analysis of large corpora with qualitative interpretation, to reconstruct how *innovation*, *data*, *automation*, and *AI* became naturalized in the journalistic field.

I should note that during my research on the subject the imaginary of innovation seems to be especially powerfull in regards to identity formation. It is my belief that the formation and the ownership of the innovation narrative/storyline seems to be what captures hearts and minds.

So I put forward a synthesis of theoretical frameworks to systematically analyze media and scholarly sources—while leaving space to examine **counter-imaginaries** that are often overlooked.

## 1) Narratives as cognitive frameworks

As  Bruner argued, we organize experience and memory **narratively**—stories, excuses, myths, reasons for doing and not doing. Narrative is how complexity becomes sense.

Drawing on cognitive science and **León (2016)**, narratives can be treated as a **structured form of knowledge** with identifiable components—a definition (via Finlayson & Corman) as *a sequence of causally related events involving specific characters and times, organized beyond basic coherence*. León further introduces **narrative memory**: the subset of episodic and semantic memory that stores information with narrative features, outlining an architecture for building **networks of narrative objects**—in effect, a data structure for memory that mirrors story structure.

Other narratology work extends into political science and cognitive psychology, supplying concepts and best practices for analysis and (importantly) for **narrative construction**. **Dennison (2021)** adds that narratives often carry implicit or explicit **normative messages** about what is right and what should be done—key for uncovering *counter-imaginaries* usually glossed over.

**Takeaway:** treat narratives not merely as persuasion tools but as **cultural artefacts** that carry a system’s normative load and illuminate the micro-mechanisms through which imaginaries are felt, internalized, and reproduced by professional actors.

## 2) Sociotechnical imaginaries in public communication

From a communication-studies perspective, **Sociotechnical Imaginaries in Public Communication (SIPCs)** (*Brause et al., 2025*) offer an operational, six-level framework for analyzing media texts, policy briefs, and adjacent materials:

1. **Vision**  
2. **Desirability**  
3. **Futures**  
4. **Technological Object**  
5. **Speaker**  
6. **Implications**

This model treats imaginaries as **analyzable communicative phenomena**, enabling systematic coding of how visions are articulated and stabilized. I also suggest extending the model with two **cognitive-affective layers** to capture how messages bind to identity and feeling.

## 3) Cognitive-affective dimensions: identity & feeling

**Social Identity Theory (SIT)** (Tajfel; Turner) explains how group belonging shapes perception and behaviour. In journalism, technological adoption often becomes a **marker of belonging**—to *be digital* or *data-driven* might signal in-group status.

**Feelings-as-Information** (Schwarz) complements this: people read their **affective states**—hope, fear, pride, anxiety—as cues about reality and action. Individuals often treat affect as **evidence** when evaluating technological futures.

**Together, identity and affect** explain how emotion becomes social glue: *feeling → identification; identification → durable imaginaries.*

---

## Toward an integrated analytical model

By combining **narrative cognition**, **public-communication analysis**, and **cognitive-affective theory**, we can assemble a **multi-layered framework** for tracing sociotechnical imaginaries—linking macro-level stories to the micro-mechanisms through which they become meaningful, affective, and operational in practice.

## From journalism to AI (and back to us)

In Part I mapped what imaginaries are and this post sketched how to trace them, here’s where the lens turns outward. I’m starting with journalism because it performs its imaginaries in public—on the record, in headlines and workflows. But it is the same machinery that is already shaping how we talk about **AI**.

Think of it this way: stories move through networks, recruit identities, and lean on shortcuts. Hope, fear, authority—these are the engines that facilitate how fast a storyline travels. In debates about AI, those engines are loud: miracle saves vs. existential threats, experts invoked, everyone-is-doing-it momentum. None of this is “just rhetoric.” It’s how imaginaries get built and stabilized.

A quick referance to Anderson’s *imagined communities*: most of us will never meet, yet we feel part of the same “we” because we share media, symbols, and reference points. AI talk works the same—memes, policy slogans, success stories. Shared stories create a sense of belonging long before the tech is evenly distributed.
