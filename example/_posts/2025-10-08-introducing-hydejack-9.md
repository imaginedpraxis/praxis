# Part I — Imaginaries as Systems

## The rise of sociotechnical imaginaries

The topic of sociotechnical imaginaries has been on the rise for the past few years.

Academic research on the field basically delves into how collective perceptions take root and shape common perceptions in the realm of public life, as well as the promises of desirable futures and the subsequent policy formulations that derive from those.

With a sharp rise in the subjects of *digital humanities* and *STS*, paired with the advent of AI, the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries has come into the spotlight, especially in regard to AI, as a means to both grasp and formulate—to some extent—the future and our perception of it.

## Jasanoff’s definition

The seminal work by Sheila Jasanoff, *Dreamscapes of Modernity: Sociotechnical Imaginaries and the Fabrication of Power* (2015), set the tone to a large extent for contemporary scholarly work. There she defined them as:

> collectively held, institutionally stabilised, and publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technology.

## Purpose and scope of this essay

This essay aims to explore the conceptual foundations of imaginaries—particularly sociotechnical and collective imaginaries—by proposing that they be understood as systems: interlocking, normative frameworks that structure collective visions of social order. While the contemporary debate often centers on the technological dimensions of imaginaries, especially in the age of AI, this essay highlights the systemic and identity-producing nature of imaginaries as mechanisms through which societies narrate, sustain, and legitimize themselves, and sheds light on the ways that these imaginaries can be co-opted or even coerced.

## Beyond technology: institutions matter

In this first part, we are going to get into the imaginaries side of the concept as an introduction. It is rather useful, though, to remark that even though the sociotechnical side seems to be on the rise—mostly due to AI, as discussed—it is essential to keep in mind that sociotechnical imaginaries do not just focus on technology but on social institutions as well.

## A historical lens on normativity

Under that lens, it would be useful for further analysis to be done from the perspective of history, in order to better trace those imaginaries—visions that have long been at work, not because of technology but rather because of the way society has come to comprehend institutions and ideas such as the rule of law, education, schools, and even faith. The interplay of these idealizations has long been constituting the essence of normativity.

## Imaginaries as systems

To that tune, and because people tend to mix imaginaries with some kind of concept that has to do with fantasy rather than a real concept that can be operationalized, I propose that these imaginaries be better understood as systems. Imaginaries are the end goal—the vision of a complex system at work. That is not to say that there is only one system at work, as there is not one ideal vision of society, but rather an interplay of systems—even antagonistic in some cases—that can balance each other and foster a normative perception of social functions, public policy, and collective expectations.

## Castoriadis and the productive imaginary

As discussed, even though scholarly work on sociotechnical imaginaries is a rather contemporary topic, work on collective imaginaries has been longstanding and quite advanced.

Castoriadis was amongst the first scholars to acknowledge the concept of social imaginaries in his main work *The Imaginary Institution of Society*, in which he affirms them as productive.

He is not content with seeing them as just past representations of social structures or doctrines but rather as the embodied practices of society at all levels.

## Anderson and imagined communities

A better-understood concept of imaginaries is provided by Anderson in his seminal work *Imagined Communities*, in which he makes the point that the concept—the idea—of a Nation in itself is an imagined social structure. For Anderson, people accept this idea of belonging through mutually shared symbols, narratives, and language, and he makes a special point on the use of media as the means to propagate these common meanings in order to create the mental image of communal living inside the framework of a nation-state.

A rather important point needs to be made here, as Anderson dedicated a large part of his work to the actual workings and making of national identity.

Identity is as well a fictional product that is sustained by narratives propagated through symbols, institutions, and the media. National identities, in large part, are sustained on the master narrative that is produced primarily by history. The point that needs to be made here does not have to do with whether those identities are real or not but rather with their functional role inside the system or imaginary that they are a part of.

## Identity as the cog in the machine

It is my point that identity is the cog in the machine. It is because of the concept of identity and the vision that is consequently produced that systems remain at work. An erosion on the part of identity and/or its comprehension of the system—or rather its normative vision of it—means the eventual degradation of the system as a whole. That is why current trends in disinformation studies have to do with both narratives and their relation to social, national, or personal identities. Once the identity part has been affected, the actual cog has stopped working towards the intended-normative vision for a society. Another big part of the identity conceptualization is what is called hetero-definition: for an identity to work and to settle, it is essential to be defined by something different from it.

That is why even antagonizing systems can—and often do—work in tandem to craft the same identity.

## Ricoeur and narrative identity 

At this point, it is valuable to draw on Paul Ricoeur’s notion of narrative identity, which helps explain how identity functions as the organizing mechanism within imaginary systems. Ricoeur argued that identity is not a fixed essence but a narrative construction—a way of achieving coherence by bringing together the heterogeneous elements of life into a single storyline. He distinguished between *idem-identity* (sameness and stability) and *ipse-identity* (selfhood and the capacity to act and reinterpret). Imaginaries, in this sense, depend on both—the stability of shared institutions and the openness to reinterpretation and adaptation.

Ricoeur also underlined that identity is relational, shaped through recognition and difference—“selfhood implies otherness to such an intimate degree that one cannot be thought without the other.” This ties directly to the idea of hetero-definition mentioned earlier. Finally, in *Memory, History, Forgetting*, he notes that collective identities, much like individual ones, are formed “in and through stories recounted.” From this view, imaginaries can be seen as narrative systems, as stories societies tell themselves to sustain coherence, legitimacy, and meaning.

In this light, imaginaries emerge not only as systemic frameworks but as narrative processes that continuously reproduce the social imagination.

## Taylor and the normative imaginary

Lastly, for Taylor, the focal point on imaginaries lies in “the way ordinary people imagine their social surroundings.” The main concept of this approach lies in the normative essence of the imaginary. In his meaning, social imaginaries include elements from popular culture that contribute to this realization of common sense.

## Ezrahi and performative fictions

In addition to these scholars, Ezrahi’s work on the democratic imaginaries provides a fruitful analysis of how these conceptions of imaginaries can be more effectively analyzed and studied. In his work, he focuses on what he terms political fictions that can cause political behavior. Ezrahi’s work centers in large part on the political and performative imaginaries that guide—or can potentially guide—society, behaviors, policy, and normative visions of the future.

Furthermore, he suggests a three-level taxonomy of these political imaginaries that, according to his view, are fundamental to postmodern political imagination. By integrating his theory into the concept of sociotechnical systems, his work can be used as a guide for the utilization of these political imaginaries. He also notes the looming danger of undermining belief in a set of regime-supporting strategies. The goal of these imaginaries, according to his analysis and in his words, is “advancing knowledge,” highlighting in this way the instrumental function that imagination has.

### The three levels of imagination

- **Reflective imagination** — representations of the past: specific moods, emotions, and narratives imposed on unaware subjects.  
- **Fictive imagination** — fictions that may be politically transformed into causes, including cultural re-appropriations that can shape political behaviors.  
- **Instrumental imagination** — the conceptual sum, a means to an end, a new normative vision for society.

Ezrahi also delves into what he terms performative imagination, which in his conceptual model is the political arena inside of which the real and the fantastic alternate. Furthermore, he makes a point on the concept of political marketing, where rhetorical practices and notions of causality blend. To him both historization and naturalization were the main pillars of post-modern political thinking.

## Branding, marketing, and symbolic triggers

I would add that the notion of political marketing also encapsulates a wide range of marketing functions that, even though they are not directly analyzed in communication or marketing studies, can in effect trigger both reflective imaginative states as well as fictive ones. For example, the notion of a brand does not just aspire to the creation of a logo or a Q&A that is done for promotional reasons on some social media platform. Branding has to do with how the product is received and perceived by the wider public, what the expectations of it are, and what it means for them. In the same line of thought, political branding continues to play a role even if the party in question is not in power, as long as it had cultivated a strong normative vision. And to that same tune events can trigger the reflective part of imagination in an effort to restore the normativity visions of a past identity.

External events can even cause this effect — a strong economic crisis is possible to usher in political fictions that focus on the technocratic or even neoliberal imaginary in order to restore political fictions that promise a better economic future. A threat of war can work in the same way. Strong symbolisms can in theory trigger those effects in question.

## Toward information architectures

I aim for additional conceptual work on the concept of **Information Architectures** inside the framework of **Sociotechnical Systems**, in conjunction to identity formation, as network flows can reach targeted subpopulations and facilitate certain types of behaviors, norms, and ideas, while suppressing others, a closer examination of the affordances of the available networks as well as the interactions that happen is where the contemporary proccess of identity formation is facilitated in real time.

## A caution on identity drift

It would be useful to understand that these imaginaries though also mean that a different identity is effectively formed, that can work against the institutions that helped form it.

## Closing and transition

Bringing together Castoriadis’s productive imagination, Anderson’s imagined communities, Ricoeur’s narrative self, and Ezrahi’s performative fictions, we can start to see imaginaries as complex, interdependent systems. They do not simply reflect the world but actively build it. The following section will trace how these systems can be unintetionally degraded as well as manipulated.
