# Thesis on Digital Heuristics

This thesis explores how digital political communication is reshaped in the context of hybrid media systems by examining the interplay between platform architectures, digital heuristics, and adaptive strategies.

Drawing from academic literature on hybrid media systems, political communication, and digital architecture, the research synthesizes theoretical advances to analyze how political actors respond and should respond to algorithmic environments, media abundance, and technological affordances.

Through a systematic theoretical review (2013â€“2024), the thesis categorizes platform-specific and hybridity-based digital heuristics, and assesses how these influence strategic political behavior. It also addresses the democratic and ethical implications of algorithmic governance and AI-driven messaging, particularly in the Greek political landscape. Special focus is placed on Greeceâ€™s partial adaptation to digital campaigning, highlighting constraints in personalization, platform use, and strategic consistency.

Ultimately, the study proposes a refined framework for understanding digitally mediated political behavior, emphasizing the need for platform-literate, adaptive strategies that align with democratic principles in increasingly automated media environments.
