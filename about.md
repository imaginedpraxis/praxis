# CodeBook - Political Communication

Its obvious that Social Media has made it simple to obtain information and consequently to engage with it and often share it.

So, I’ve been thinking for some time about creating a codebook of theories and techniques used in political communication that facilitate the propagation of news ,fake news and misinformation.

This blog has mostly been about imaginaries—the big picture—but the actual work is in the moves.

The intent is to compile and synthesize psychological and social science theories that make people vulnerable—or simply more receptive—to political communication, alongside practical techniques.

I’ll continue to enrich this with more specific digital techniques—especially focused on social media, which is what I’m currently working on—but for now, this is it.
